`bubblyr` is an R wrapper of the JavaScript library [bubbly-bg](https://github.com/tipsy/bubbly-bg). It allows you to add beautiful animated bubbles within your Shiny application's background. You can choose from several themes and apply the animation with one line of code. 


## Installation

You can install the development version of `bubblyr` from Github with: 


```{r, eval=FALSE}

install.packages("remotes") #if not installed

remotes::install_github("feddelegrand7/bubblyr")

```




# Themes

Here a list of all the available themes. Note that The ocean, cherry, hippie, bigmom and deepsea themes are provided by the author of the bubbly-bg library, I just gave them some fancy names: 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
list <- c(
    "ocean",
    "cherry",
    "hippie",
    "bigmom",
    "deepsea",
    "illusion",
    "rstudio",
    "ash",
    "classy",
    "volcano",
    "lacoste",
    "warmup",
    "fire",
    "traffic",
    "life",
    "darksky",
    "orangina",
    "meteor"
  )

knitr::kable(list, col.names = "Themes")
```

Below you can find some examples, feel free to experiment the remaining themes: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(bubblyr)

ui <- fluidPage(

    bubbly(theme = "meteor")

)

server <- function(input, output) {}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)

```

![](man/meteor.gif)



```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(bubblyr)

ui <- fluidPage(

    bubbly(theme = "bigmom")

)

server <- function(input, output) {}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)

```

![](man/bigmom.gif)


```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(bubblyr)

ui <- fluidPage(

    bubbly(theme = "rstudio")

)

server <- function(input, output) {}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)

```


![](man/rstudio.gif)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(bubblyr)

ui <- fluidPage(

    bubbly(theme = "classy")

)

server <- function(input, output) {}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)

```
